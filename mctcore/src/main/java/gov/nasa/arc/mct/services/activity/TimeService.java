/**
 * This interface provides time related functionality for the current activity. Activity time
 * is based on the time in the current mission which may be a simulation (in which case the time is different than the
 * wall clock time and clock ticks may deviate significantly) or be slightly delayed to reflect latency between
 * the vehicle and the ground systems.
 * An instance can be obtained through OSGI, using code like:
 * {@code
 *    org.osgi.framework.BundleContext bc = ... // will be obtained through an activator
 *    ServiceReference ref = bc.getServiceReference(TimeService.class.getName());
 *    if (ref != null)
 *      TimeService registry = (TimeService) bc.getService(ref);
 *    ...
 *    bc.ungetServiceReference(ref);
 * }
 * An instance of this class can also be obtained using the
 * <a href="http://www.eclipsezone.com/eclipse/forums/t97690.html">OSGI declarative
 * service functionality</a>.
